[1] Create a base directory from which you shall be working, e.g.:
mkdir ~/SPPIM

[2] Move Install.tar into the base directory and untar:  tar -xvf Install.tar


[3] Find out where on your system the SAC library is located. It probably is in
/usr/local/sac/lib/libsacio.a or if you have a Mac with the new processor it may be
in /usr/local/lib/libsacio_bsd.a (type echo $SACHOME to find out where SAC resides).
If you do not have SAC, get it from your system manager or download it yourself from https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/sac/ (you must register).

[4] If your SAC library is *not* in /usr/local/sac/lib/libsacio.a you must edit
the script Compile_all and replace the reference to sacio with the one on your
system.

[5] If your system does not have gfortran as a compiler, edit script Compile_all
to use your preferred compiler, or download gfortran from 
https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/

[6] If you do not yet have a directory ~/bin for your executables, create it:
mkdir ~/bin
To add it to your $PATH variable. If you use bash add
export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
to .bash_profile. For other systems check which file has the PATH declaration and
add it in a similar way as other directories.

[7] If you do not yet have GMT version 6, get it from https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org

[8] Finally, go into PickingCode and type:
./Compile_all

You should be all set! If you encounter difficulties please email me at nolet@princeton.edu
