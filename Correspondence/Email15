[1] Must alias in csh:

I'm working on a Mac in zsh.

dopick/other picking codes seem to be written in csh.

So I specifically had to add "alias gv /usr/bin/open" to ~/.cshrc.

(the alias syntax is different between the two shells, hence I note it here)

Also had to change hardcorded "/Users/auguste/data/..." in pointa.f90, like
Frederik mentioned earlier.

Finally I don't have GMT on my local machine so I had to comment all occurrences
of pltres in dopick.

After all these changes had to Compile_all again etc.

[2] SAC error for window resize:

My x11 window for the actual pick opens on my left screen, which is
vertical. The SAC window is too wide for the vertical screen and too tall for
the neighboring horizontal screen. When I drag to horizontal screen and attempt
to resize x11 window I get this error -->

 ERROR  901: SAC programming logic error : Window resized during PPK
 	 Exiting from PPK because picks are inaccurate after resize.
	 	  Window resizing must be done before entering PPK.
 ERROR 1016: Terminating execution of macro doppk
 Command line is: ppk perplot 2

Solution as of now: slide window back and forth across screens to get full
view, though I find it really frustrating I cannot ever see the entire X11 in
one view. I will try to find a solution for this, leading to [3]

[3] Default X11 window:

Spent an hour+ googling and playing with setting the $DISPLAY to try to get x11
to open in my horizontal screen with proper dimensions. No dice; maybe someone
else knows a simple solution (I know it exists I just can't figure it out).

One tip: DO NOT check the box under X11 Preferences > Output > "Full-screen
mode." That turns of your screens into a useless black box with nothing on that
you cannot close.

<< gave up and started picking >>

[4] Where are AIC picks on MERMAID in 2018/20180928/DATA/Q00 (maybe they are so
late they are off screen...I didn't check), because for some other events the
AIC pick is on the waveform.

[5] I repeated an event and after the repeat it did not ask me to specify a
time bias -- I just hit enter after "r" to repeat, and then when it was done it
closed the program without again asking me to specify. Is the idea, then, that I
would add expected time biases individually in the "add_to_datafile"

[6] 20211214, e.g., Wake: As you write in your notes, I also I don't know if I'm
picking P or pP around 548 s. Now this is a case I would NOT apply a time bias
based on the STF (time bias is to account for ISC picking foreshock?)?  I need a
refresher on how/when to apply a time bias (and individual vs. collective).

    And do we trust the polarity? DZM should be down. I see up...(oh, I see you
    write the same thing in your notes).

    Reading the STF: do we call it/worry about a foreshock if the first pulse of
    energy is not large/the largest, e.g., 20190412?  And if so, remind me: we
    want to pick the MAIN shock and then add a time bias for the foreshock? (I
    know I'm repeating myself/questions).

[7] Random note: adds EXIT after the current event regardless of if you have
actually done it; i.e., if you run pnext and quit the program before picking
pnext will skip it next time you run it. Something to be aware of.

[8] Other random note: I found inconsistencies in questions about tbias depending
on how 

[9] When you say you reject an event, does that mean you make no picks? (or if
you did make picks, you will delete the files and/or repeat event and not make
any picks?) -- I just kept all picks for this exercise.

[10] "reject since only MERMAID did not allow picking" -- is this something we
need to be careful about or will your inversion be smart enough to identify
events with no unique (MERMAID) data stream?

[11] Inconsistency/confused with pnext: if I hit RETURN/ENTER to this question
(so I don't type "n" "t" or "r") --

"[n]ext event, give nonzero [t]bias, or [r]epeat?"

I then get this question:

"Give tbias for rdapf2, or 0: "

and then the next event is queued up.

BUT, if instead I hit "n" to first question, the second question does not appear
and the program closes and I must run pnext again.

And furthermore, since pnext is still running in the background I suppose, no
add_to_datafile or out.pointa are written to (until pnext finishes, I'd guess)?
I struggled with this happening and having to redo events a lot.

Oh..returning to this question. It seems that if you don't answer the question
the default is to repeat the same event?l

[12]  Added nonzero time bias to file and not sure 

Outstanding questions I need to figure out:

Make sure time bias properly written to "add_to..." file. I responded to
question with 2 but I don't think it was properly written?

[13] "20190122 - stf seems OK, good for hp. P06 is near nodal plane, on hp F
picks it slightly late. Residu plot OK. Accept." I cannot for the life of me see
an arrival here.

[14] "M53 onset is visible after F, just before pP, on the unfiltered
record. Accept." How? I do not see anything.

What I need:

* I would love to run through all these examples with you on Zoom.
* I need help/tips formatting X11 so it fits on my screen.
* I need a refresher on time bias; when/how to apply.
* I need someone to watch me run though pnext w/, w/o adding tbias and seeing
  it's written correctly (inconstancy question above; if you respond or not to
  questions after picks).
