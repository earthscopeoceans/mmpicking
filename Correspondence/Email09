Dear all, 

I just transferred the 2023 data to ariel, this is now complete. I
also fixed the few directories that had a wrong event depth.

And finally, I added the predicted time for pPn to the SAC headers (if
it exists). This was needed because SAC’s traveltime command does not
adhere to the official nomenclature and labels deep events ‘Pn’ in the
near field. I also considered adding sP and sPn but decided not to do
that, as it clutters the picking plot too much. However, should you
wish to identify them, the following command adds them to the header:

traveltime model ak135 verbose picks 4 phase sP sPn

and if you follow this up with ‘wh’ it writes it permanently in the SAC file.

Happy picking! I will try some myself as well before taking off on a trip to Lausanne.
