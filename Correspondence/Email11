Dear all,

I finished picking the records of about 1000 records until the end of 2018. The 
results are in the file .pointa.

It takes me about an hour to do 10 events, depending on how many
complicated records there are for an event. Some events are picked in
just 2 or 3 minutes, others require some experimenting with
filtering. The bottom line is that it will take about 300 man-hours to
do the full data set.

The AIC picks (F) offer a very good guide to the onset but are generally later 
than the picks by eye (A). The histogram is highest for a difference of 0.2s, 
the largest differences for shallow events. Here are three plots:

While picking I kept notes on most of the seismograms, which I attach below.

Best wishes,
Guust
