Dear all,

I just ftp’d a series of plots into the 2023 data directory of ariel —
I had not noticed that one tar file with plots never made it across
the ocean when I transferred data last month. So if you made a copy of
the data on your machine, please re-copy all of 2023, that is the
easiest.

Also, when you pick and you notice that there is no global plot with
island stations, this means that there were no low-noise island
station records for that event. You can skip such events since this
very likely means its mermaid data are not very reliable either.

Best wishes,

Guust
