The crust cluster #2 has a few hard choicesâ€¦ Again, if no Mermaid is pickable 
because of noise, just reject that event and erase the add_to file. I am 
currently working at it and find that I often need to look at a larger window to 
judge the noise level. I prefer
to do this in a separate window, but the alternative is to widen a bit the 
window in script <mkdoppk>. If you feel like experimenting, change the lower 
limit of line 22 and 24 from -6 to, say, -15, e.g.:

  22   echo 'xlim t0 -15 t0 +16' >> doppk
  23   echo 'ELSE' >> doppk
  24   echo 'xlim t0 -15 t0 +10' >> doppk
  25   echo 'ENDIF' >> doppk

Best wishes,
