Dear all,

I assembled the Mermaid data (with updated hypocentres and origin times) and 
relevant FDSN island stations plus plots for 2018...

A description is in the PDF... and SAC picking scripts + some processing
software...

It took me some time to filter the FDSN data to a useful quantity, but
I chose enough to

(1) allow for a quick view of the waveform of the onset and 

(2) to use them in combination with Mermaid data for an origin time
correction. 

After reflection I think correcting just the time and not the
hypocentre is the best strategy to follow for the inversion, but we
can discuss this also with the other SPPIM participants. 

The flipside is that we need to pick a dozen or so island station
records in addition to the Mermaids.

The file SPPIMdata.pdf describes how I do that.

You probably have your own programs for picking but please try the SAC
macro ‘doppk’ that is created by ‘mkdoppk’ for each event and see if
that works for you. If not, let us communicate how you can put your
results in a format like that of rdapf2 which post-processes the SAC
output such that it can be combined into input for my inversion
software.
