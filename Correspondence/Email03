I attach a version (mkdoppk2) that does a 1 Hz hi-pass for picking. Like mkdoppk 
it creates a SAC macro named doppk.

Contrary to what mkdoppk said, there is no need to move the APF file to APF.org 
if you do a second round of picking on the same data set. So I edited that out 
of mkdoppk and I attach both of them.


Best wishes,

Guust

Frederik: the old file mkdopp was renamed mkdopp0
