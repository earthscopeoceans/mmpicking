Here is another plot. I grouped the residuals by station for the GSN
data. If all events were at exactly the same place, all dta for one
station should be the same. There is a spread because raypaths sample
different regions of the earth.

If we assume that the ’true’ spread is accurately depicted by the that
in low-noise Australian stations CAN,CTAO,TAU, SNZO in New Zealand and
MSVF on the large island of Fiji, then the admissible spread would be
of the order of 2 seconds. 

In many island stations it is clearly larger. So our differences are
strongly influenced by noise levels. It is a warning not to pick when
noise amplitude is high.

A similar plot cannot be made for the Mermaids because they change
position all the time.

Best wishes,
