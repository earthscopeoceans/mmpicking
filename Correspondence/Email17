dta.pdf

I compared the out.pointa files. The file out.cfam has all readings
(translated into residual dta) for files that have been picked by more
than one person. 

The plot dta.pdf shows these picks as blue dots, the averages as red
triangles. 

Finally, out.pointa.combined has the pointa files grouped by event.

There are some major differences, exceeding what I expected! Please
have a look.
