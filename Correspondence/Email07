Dear all,

I noticed that the time window hardwired in doppk (-6 to +10s after P) is too 
small, as there are sometimes very large delays at shorter distances (see 
example plot where the upper mantle is about 10% slow over a distance of 7.9 
degree).

I therefore widened to window in case the distance is less than 20 degrees to 
+20s after P.  I also now show a high-passed
version on top and a low-passed version below. You can click on either one of 
them to pick the onset, whichever is the better one.

If you need more precision, there is now also a script mkmoreppk. You call it 
separately for each seismogram that you wish to zoom, with the (negative) head 
and the positive tail, e.g.:

mkmoreppk -6 +12 II.MSVF*

and it will restrict the window to [t0-6,t0+12] in this case. It will add the 
new reading to APF; if there was an older reading it will be ignored by rdapf2.


Best wises,

Guust
