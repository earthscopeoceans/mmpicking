Dear all,

I hope AGU was exciting.

While assembling the data sets on nolet@ariel, I noticed the
similarity of the seismograms of closely spaced events. This may help
in picking, certainly if one starts with the stronger events in one
cluster and move down to the smaller magnitudes.

I therefore computed a list of clusters. In the home directory, youâ€™ll
find two files: CRUSTClusters and DEEPClusters, which list 49 clusters
each for crustal- and deep events respectively. Within each cluster,
events are ranked from high to low magnitude (2nd column). At the end
of each file I also list the directories chronologically.

The idea is that, when we divide up the work, we should assign
*clusters* to the participants.

I am halfway 2021 in assembling data sets & plots, hope to get it done
before I travel for a week March 3-10.

Best wishes,

Guust
