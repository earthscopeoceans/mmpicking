I discovered zoom with X does work on my Mac. You need to type X
twice. Type <help plotpktable> and you see all the possible entries
for ppk:

x        Set Zoom window
           - Set beginning of zoomed plot
           - If x is second keystroke, set end of zoomed window and display
           - If s is second keystroke, defined zoomed plot limits are saved
             and used as xlims for subsequent plots
o        Zoom Out => Displays previous plot window.
           A maximum of five windows are saved.

Best wishes,

Guust
