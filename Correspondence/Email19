I also attach a slightly modified version OF dopick. It avoids going
into repeat mode if you type an unknown character by accident, which
happened to me twice... Note that if you type <r> for repeat, you only
have to redo the picks you are unhappy about, since it will still read
the old ones from the APF file — contrary to what I have perhaps said
earlier.

One note about the SAC cheat sheet: if you use the SPECTROGRAM command, be aware 
that it computes spectra over a 2s window, and these windows are 1s apart. You 
must look at the maxima, not the edges, to find out where a high frequency 
enters the seismogram, but its precision is 1s at best. In general Joel’s AIC 
(F)  picks do a better job recognizing the whereabouts of the onset, though in 
case you suspect F picks pP the spectrogram can come in handy.
