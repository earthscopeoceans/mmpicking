Dear all,

Although I was always sceptical about the use of predicted polarity, I
discovered that for the stronger events the SCARDEC double couple
solutions may do a better job for us (probably because they were
derived from the high frequency P waves rather than the low-frequency
CMT solutions). See scardec.projects.sismo.ipgp.fr

I therefore redid the sisav.pdf plots. 

They may now include predicted polarity as background colour
(red=down, blue=up) from SCARDEC for the larger events, and CMT for
the smaller ones, if available.

I created them with a script, have not had the time to check them all, so be careful:

[1] for crustal events at close distance, the prediction may be wrong
since the ray angle at the source may be off,

[2] check if the low-noise stations have the polarity correctly
predicted before accepting them for the noisier ones.

I think the new plots may be very helpful to pick onsets correctly for
the noisier records whenever there is an ambiguity.

If there is a source time function file stf.pdf in the Qnn/ directory,
this means the prediction is based on SCARDEC. If not, from
ds.iris.edu/spud/momenttensor and out.CMT gives the detailed tensor
(zero if not available).

I attach an example sisaz.pdf

best wishes,
