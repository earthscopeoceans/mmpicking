Oh, and a few questions/notes from this round:

[1] On polarity plot is the reference for up/down the start of the trace? See
    for example 2023 287 6:34:10 sisaz.pdf, where RAO in red and blue.

AK135 predicts the onset at the time of the small circle on the
trace, so the up/down should be close to this circle. The circle is
plotted at the distance/azimuth of the station

[2] Where is P0040 on 2021 263 18:08:17 sisaz.pdf / MERMAIDs on smap.pdf
    (MERMAID also missing from smap.pdf for 2022 38 06:01:20, and I think I
    noticed others as well)

The seismogram is there, but the label P0040 falls outside of the plot
(I void overprinting of labels by moving them higher than the previous
one).

[3] Accidentally didn't answer question after picking; answered repeat
    question with "n" and it did not open pick file in vi, generate
    add_to* file, nor update out.pointa

You can only <r>epeat once with script <dopick>. If you decide you
wish to redo you should type the command by hand, e.g.:

dopick 2022/20220207/DATA/Q01

without using pnext. Be sure not to erase the APF file (unless you
really wish to start from scratch).

All the best

Guust

PS to ALL: I have just assembled all add_to files and done the
raytracing for an inversion to see how many outliers we have. I should
have some results by the time we start the Zoom
