Dear Joel,

In response to your questions:

[1] I am used to scripting in csh even though Mac now uses zsh, but I have never 
noticed one must put aliases in .cshrc.

It is worthwhile to get GMT, the new ‘modern’ version GMT6 is much more 
user-friendly than GMT5 and extremely powerful .

[2] Resize while picking. SAC allows resize of the windows with the WINDOW 
command (type: help window).

If you wish to change the window for picking, that has to be inserted into doppk
which is written by mkdoppk. For example, if you wish the window to have half 
the size of your screen in both x- and y-direction, add this line to mkdoppk after
echo 'oapf name' > doppk

echo 'WINDOW 1 XSIZE 0.5 1.0 YSIZE 0 0.5' >> doppk

(this will place the window in the upper left corner of your screen).

(note the line reflects a correction by Guust)

[3] abnormal X11 size: on my Mac the windows start with size 80x30 characters. 
Do you have very large characters? Can you resize by hand (click on bottom right 
corner and drag)?
My Mac uses XQuartz, I am not sure what the difference is with X11, what does 
yours have?

[4] Absent F for 20180928/Q00? I checked ariel, the *.sac files do have F in the 
header:
[nolet@ariel Q00]$ sac
   FILE: 20180928T101248.09_5BAE4C6A.MER.DET.WLT5.sac - 1
  -------------------------------------------------
      F = 6.904600e+02
     FILE: 20180928T101307.10_5BAE4E32.MER.DET.WLT5.sac - 2
  --------------------------------------------------
      F = 7.164800e+02
   FILE: 20180928T101416.12_5BAE4E14.MER.DET.WLT5.sac - 3
  --------------------------------------------------
      F = 7.660700e+02
   FILE: 20180928T101434.25_5BAE4A90.MER.DET.WLT5.sac - 4
  --------------------------------------------------
      F = 7.978700e+02

[5] The <r> for repeat does the following:
- it erases the add_to file
- it asks for tbias
- it calls SAC with doppk
- after the new picking it puts them into header variable A
- it exits
So you should not get a second chance to do <r>. If you decide you wish to redo
the picks, follow Frederik's suggestion and start from scratch. That also avoids
that old A values remain in the header for records you decide not to pick on 
second thought.
Note: script dopick asks for <n>,<t> or <r>, but in effect any character you type
other than <n> or <t> will revert to <r> as default. It has happened that I hit the
wrong key, so that the add_to file was erased and I was forced to pick again.

[6] When to decide on tbias - good question because there is room for debate. The
idea is that a small foreshock may only be visible in stations near the quake, 
bu drown in the noise at larger distance. So I do two things:
- I check the stf.pdf plot to see if there is a foreshock much smaller than the 
main break. Since the problem only occurs for large events (M>7, say) there is 
usually a stf plot. If the foreshock has less than, say 10-15% of the size of
the next, there is the danger that your pick in many stations and mermaids may 
be the second shock rather than the first
- I then verify the shape of the onset in nearby and far stations to see if there
is a difference.
- ONLY if I see a foreshock in the nearby stations and NOT further down the
epicentral distance road do I apply a tbias (that one I can easily read from the
stf.pdf plot).
Note: this rarely happens, so do not worry too much about it.

[7] Yes, pnext moves up the <exit> line in the <rundopicks> file when you call it,
and does not check if you abandoned picking. You have to move it one line back 
by hand if this happens.

[8] see answer to [5]

[9] When I say I reject an event it means I erase the add_to file. This may happen
after I have done some picking and abandon it on second thought.

[10] If there is no add_to file for the event it will never enter into the 
inversion. If there is one, I have not envisaged a filter to remove those
without mermaids. It could be done but it is probably not needed. The island
station data have probably many duplicated raypaths, and if the picks are good
they just add little information. If they are wrong (e.g. you decide you picked pP
instead of P) be sure to remove the add_to file.

[11] see [5]: anything except <n> or <t> results in a repeat. I can change this 
if it is a big problem, shall I?

[12] The bias is not explicitly visible in the add_to file. It is simply 
subtracted from the observed travel time in the add_to file.

[13] I attach a blow-up of P06 for 20190122. On hindsight my pick at 600.4
is a little early, it probably is closer to 600.5, while F (at 600.7) picks
an inflexion that reduces the slope (for onsets I intuitively look for *increase*
in slope). I dare pick it because the negative peak here has a higher frequency
than the noise before and a larger negative amplitude. Also, by now I have seen
many F picks that correctly identify the change in frequency content but that
are 0.1-0.3s late -- which seems to be the case here.

[14] 20220221/Q01: See p53.pdf and p53hp.pdf blow-ups. I noticed the onset must
go UP. On the unfiltered record F sees the change in frequency content (extra
wiggles on top of the noise) and goes up but without change in slope. My pick A
is where slope goes from negative to positive, so I preferred this one. The
high pass record confirms this: F does not even go up.

Bottom line: try SAC command WINDOW for resizing, do not use tbias unless you 
are absolutely sure it is needed.

We can always have another zoom!
