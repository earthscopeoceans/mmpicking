I downloaded the source time functions as determined by SCARDEC from
scardec.projects.sismo.ipgp.fr and added plots named 

stf.pdf

to the data directories on ariel.

There are only stfâ€™s for the strongest earthquakes, but in particular
for those it may be helpful to see what was actually happening on the
fault plane.

Best wishes,
Guust
