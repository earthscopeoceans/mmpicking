Dear All,

If there are no island stations (*.SAC) in a subdirectory such as Q00/
it is either because there are not good ones (low Mw, low S/N), or
because the seismograms contain PKP only. 

For now we are not picking PKP so just skip those.

I noticed that, for shallow quakes, it is sometimes much easier to
pick the pP wave than the P wave. If you pick only pP, the solution is
simple, because all you then need to do is type ‘pP’ instead of ‘P’
when you run rdapf2 (e.g.: rdapf2 pP 0.3).

However, if for some event you wish to pick P from some seismograms
and pP from others (or both P and pP), proceed as follows:

[1] Create a second directory, eg ../Q01a/ if you are in Q01/: mkdir
../Q01a

[2] Copy out.cfneic, quake, and the pP seismograms from Q01/ to
Q01a/,eg: cp out.cfneic quake *.sac *.SAC ../Q01a

[3] Pick P from Q01/ as usual

[4] Pick pP from Q01a/ and run rdapf2 with ‘pP’ instead of ‘P’

In case you feel very energetic and you wish to pick pP also from
deeper quakes for which pP falls outside of the plot: you must change
the 'xlim t0 -6 t0 +10’ line in doppk and replace the time limits such
that pP is included. Usually, SAC puts the pP arrival in marker t1, so
you would try ‘xlim t1 -6 t1 +10’ to have it start 6s before and end
10s after the AK135 predicted time.

Let me know if you have questions!
